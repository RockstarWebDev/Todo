# Todo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.


Here are the basic functionalities we can include in our Todo app:

Display Todo List: Show a list of existing todos.
Add Todo: Allow users to add new todos to the list.
Mark Todo as Complete: Provide an option to mark a todo as complete.
Edit Todo: Enable users to edit the text of an existing todo.
Delete Todo: Allow users to delete a todo from the list.
Filter Todos: Implement filters to view all todos, active todos, or completed todos.
Persist Data: Store todos in the browser's local storage to persist the data between sessions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
